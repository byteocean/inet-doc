\chapter{The UDP Model}
\label{cha:udp}


\section{Overview}

The UDP protocol is a very simple datagram transport protocol, which
basically makes the services of the network layer available to the applications.
It performs packet multiplexing and demultiplexing to ports and some basic
error detection only. 

The frame format as described in RFC768:

\begin{center}
\begin{bytefield}{32}
\bitheader{0,7,8,15,16,23,24,31} \\
\bitbox{16}{Source Port} &
\bitbox{16}{Destination Port} \\
\bitbox{16}{Length} &
\bitbox{16}{Checksum} \\
\wordbox{3}{Data}
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

The ports represents the communication end points that are allocated by the
applications that want to send or receive the datagrams. The ``Data'' field
is the encapsulated application data, the ``Length'' and ``Checksum'' fields
are computed from the data.

The INET framework contains an \nedtype{UDP} module that performs the encapsulation/decapsulation
of user packets, an \nedtype{UDPSocket} class that provides the application the usual
socket interface, and several sample applications. 

These components implement the following statndards:
\begin{itemize}
\item RFC768: User Datagram Protocol
\item RFC1122: Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers
\end{itemize}

\section{The UDP module}

The UDP protocol is implemented by the \nedtype{UDP} simple module. 
There is a module interface (\nedtype{IUDP}) that defines the gates of the
\nedtype{UDP} component. In the \nedtype{StandardHost} node, the UDP component
can be any module implementing that interface.

Each UDP module has gates to connect to the IPv4 and IPv6 network layer
(ipIn/ipOut and ipv6In/ipv6Out), and a gate array to connect to the applications
(appIn/appOut). Applications don't have to send messages directly to the UDP module,
as they can use the \cppclass{UDPSocket} class, which encapsulates the messaging and
provides a socket like interface to the applications.

\subsection{UDP commands}

The UDP module can be connected to several applications, it maintains the state
of each socket. This state can be changed by sending control messages to the UDP.
There are four message kinds to be used with control messages (UDP\_C\_BIND, UDP\_C\_CONNECT,
UDP\_C\_SETOPTION and UDP\_C\_CLOSE), and each has associated control info types that
holds the parameters of the command:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cppclass{UDPBindCommand} bind(socketId, localAddr, localPort) binds the socket to
        a local address/port
  \item \cppclass{UDPConnectCommand} connect(socetId, remoteAddr, remotePort) connects a
        socket to a remote address/port
  \item \cppclass{UDPSendCommand} send(socketId, destAddr, destPort) send data over a socket;
        destAddr and destPort can be unspecified if the socket is connected to the destination
  \item \cppclass{UDPCloseCommand} close(socketId) closes the socket
  \item \cppclass{UDPSetTimeToLiveCommand} setTimeToLive(socketId, ttl)
  \item \cppclass{UDPSetBroadcastCommand} setBroadCast(socketId, broadcast)
  \item \cppclass{UDPSetMulticastInterfaceCommand} setMulticastInterface(socketId, interfaceId)
  \item \cppclass{UDPJoinMulticastGroupCommand} joinMulticastGroupCommand(socketId, multicastAddr, interfaceId)
  \item \cppclass{UDPLeaveMulticastGroupCommand} leaveMulticastGroup(socketId, multicastAddr)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sending UDP datagrams}

For sending an UDP packet, the application should attach an \cppclass{UDPSendCommand}
object to the payload, and send it to \nedtype{UDP}. The \cppclass{UDPSendCommand}
contains the destination ip address and port. The destination address and port
can be unspecified in the control info if the socket is connected
to the destination. It is done be sending an UDP\_C\_CONNECT command to the \nedtype{UDP}
module. The connect() command can be issued several
times before closing the socket.
The \nedtype{UDP} module encapsulates the message into an \msgtype{UDPPacket},
creates an appropriate IP control info and send it over ipOut or ipv6Out.

\subsection{Receiving UDP datagrams}

Before receiving UDP datagrams applications should first ``bind'' to the given UDP port.
This can be done by sending a message with message kind UDP\_C\_BIND attached with an
\cppclass{UDPBindCommand} control info with the following fields filled in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \fvar{sockId} socket identifier, must be unique within the UDP module
  \item \fvar{localAddr} local address of the socket, if unspecified all datagrams received
        by the application, otherwise only datagrams with matching destination address,
        and multicast and broadcast messages if enabled (see below)
  \item \fvar{localPort} local port of the socket, if -1, then the UDP module chooses an unused local port
                         the localAddress/localPort combination must be unique (if localAddr is specified)
\end{itemize}

The application unbinds the socket by sending a message with UDP\_C\_CLOSE kind.

When a packet arrives from the network, first its error bit is checked. Erronous messages
are dropped by the UDP component. Otherwise the application bound to the destination port
is looked up, and the decapsulated packet passed to it. If no application is bound to
the destination port, an ICMP error is sent to the source of the packet. If the socket
is connected it can only receive packets from its remote partner.

The control info of the decapsulated packet contains information about
the source and destination address/port the TTL field of the packet
and the interfaceId on which the packet was received.

The \nedtype{UDP} module also processes the received ICMP errors, it sends an error
notification to the application. The notification is a message with UDP\_I\_ERROR
kind and with attached control info with \cppclass{UDPErrorIndication}.
The control info contains the source and destination address and ports of the undeliverable
message.

The applications are bound to the unspecified local address, then they receive any packets
targeted to their port. UDP also supports multicast and broadcast addresses; if they
are used as destination address, all nodes in the multicast group or subnet receives the packet.
The socket receives the broadcast packets if it was enabled and unconnected or connected to the
sender. The socket receives the multicast packets if its joined to the multicast group addressed
by destination of the packet and it is unconnected or connected to the sender.
\begin{note}
The \nedtype{UDP} module supports only local broadcasts (using the special 255.255.255.255 address).
Packages that are broadcasted to a remote subnet are handled as undeliverable messages.
\end{note}

\subsection{Signals}

The \nedtype{UDP} module emits the following signals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \fsignal{sentPk} when an UDP packet sent to the ip, the packet
  \item \fsignal{rcvdPk} when an UDP packet received from the ip, the packet
  \item \fsignal{passedUpPk} when a packet passed up to the application, the packet
  \item \fsignal{droppedPkWrongPort} when an undeliverable UDP packet received, the packet
  \item \fsignal{droppedPkBadChecksum} when an erronous UDP packet received, the packet
\end{itemize}

% FIXME connect() or bind() should not be mandatory before sending packets or setting options
% FIXME connect() should allow unspecified dest address and -1 port (interpreted as disconnect())
% FIXME sending broadcast messages should be disallowed if SO_BROADCAST is false
% FIXME there should be a separate TTL for multicast (not used for unicast), default value is 1
% TODO clarify: multicast packets should not be delivered to connected sockets?

\section{UDP sockets}

UDPSocket is a convenience class, to make it easier to send and receive
UDP packets from your application models. You'd have one (or more)
UDPSocket object(s) in your application simple module class, and call
its member functions (bind(), connect(), sendTo(), etc.) to create and
configure a socket, and to send datagrams.

UDPSocket chooses and remembers the sockId for you, assembles and sends command
packets such as UDP\_C\_BIND to UDP, and can also help you deal with packets and
notification messages arriving from UDP.

Here is a code fragment that creates an UDP socket and sends a 1K packet
over it (the code can be placed in your handleMessage() or activity()):

\begin{cpp}
UDPSocket socket;
socket.connect(IPvXAddress("10.0.0.2"), 2000);

cPacket *pk = new cPacket("dgram");
pk->setByteLength(1024);
socket.send(pk);

socket.close();
\end{cpp}

% when the localAddr is unspecified by the socket (~ INADDR_ANY), then the kernel sets the
% source address field of the outgoing packet according to the outgoing interface

Processing messages sent up by the UDP module is relatively straightforward.
You only need to distinguish between data packets and error notifications,
by checking the message kind (should be either UDP\_I\_DATA or UDP\_I\_ERROR),
and casting the control info to UDPDataIndication or UDPErrorIndication.
USPSocket provides some help for this with the \ffunc{belongsToSocket()} and
\ffunc{belongsToAnyUDPSocket()} methods.

\section{UDP applications}

All UDP applications should be derived from the \nedtype{IUDPApp} module interface,
so that the application of \nedtype{StandardHost} could be configured without changing its NED file.

The following applications are implemented in INET:
\begin{itemize}
\item \nedtype{UDPBasicApp} sends UDP packets to a given IP address at a given interval
\item \nedtype{UDPBasicBurst} sends UDP packets to the given IP address(es) in bursts, or acts as a packet sink.
\item \nedtype{UDPEchoApp} similar to \nedtype{UDPBasicApp}, but it sends back the packet after reception
\item \nedtype{UDPSink} consumes and prints packets received from the \nedtype{UDP} module
\item \nedtype{UDPVideoStreamCli},\nedtype{UDPVideoStreamSvr} simulates UDP streaming
\end{itemize}

The next sections describe these applications in details.

\subsection{UDPBasicApp}

The \nedtype{UDPBasicApp} sends UDP packets to a the IP addresses given in the
\fpar{destAddresses} parameter. The application sends a message to one of the
targets in each \fpar{sendInterval} interval. The interval between message and
the message length can be given as a random variable. Before the packet is
sent, it is emitted in the \fsignal{sentPk} signal.

The application simply prints the received UDP datagrams. The \fsignal{rcvdPk}
signal can be used to detect the received packets.

The number of sent and received messages are saved as scalars at the end of the
simulation.

\subsection{UDPSink}

Similar to \nedtype{UDPBasicApp}, but does not send packets.

\subsection{UDPEchoApp}

Similar to \nedtype{UDPBasicApp}, but it sends back the packet after reception.
It accepts only packets with \msgtype{UDPEchoAppMsg} type, i.e. packets that
are generated by another \nedtype{UDPEchoApp}.

When an echo response received, it emits an \fsignal{roundTripTime} signal.

\subsection{UDPVideoStreamCli}

This module is a video streaming client. It send one ``video streaming request'' to
the server at time \fpar{startTime} and receives stream from \nedtype{UDPVideoStreamSvr}.

The received packets are emitted by the \fsignal{rcvdPk} signal.

\subsection{UDPVideoStreamSvr}

This is the video stream server to be used with \nedtype{UDPVideoStreamCli}.

The server will wait for incoming "video streaming requests".
When a request arrives, it draws a random video stream size
using the \fpar{videoSize} parameter, and starts streaming to the client.
During streaming, it will send UDP packets of size \fpar{packetLen} at every
\fpar{sendInterval}, until \fpar{videoSize} is reached. The parameters \fpar{packetLen}
and \fpar{sendInterval} can be set to constant values to create CBR traffic,
or to random values (e.g. sendInterval=uniform(1e-6, 1.01e-6)) to
accomodate jitter.

The server can serve several clients, and several streams per client.

% FIXME why streamVector? VideoStreamData could be deleted immediately after last byte sent

\subsection{UDPBasicBurst}

Sends UDP packets to the given IP address(es) in bursts, or acts as a
packet sink. Compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6.

\subsubsection*{Addressing}

The \fpar{destAddresses} parameter can contain zero, one or more destination
addresses, separated by spaces. If there is no destination address given,
the module will act as packet sink. If there are more than one addresses,
one of them is randomly chosen, either for the whole simulation run,
or for each burst, or for each packet, depending on the value of the
\fpar{chooseDestAddrMode} parameter. The \fpar{destAddrRNG} parameter controls which
(local) RNG is used for randomized address selection.
The own addresses will be ignored.
 
An address may be given in the dotted decimal notation, or with the module 
name. (The \cppclass{IPvXAddressResolver} class is used to resolve the address.)
You can use the "Broadcast" string as address for sending broadcast messages.

INET also defines several NED functions that can be useful: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] moduleListByPath("pattern",...): \\
         Returns a space-separated list of the modulenames.
         All modules whole getFullPath() matches one of the pattern parameters will get included.
         The patterns may contain wilcards in the same syntax as in ini files.
         See cTopology::extractByModulePath() function
         example: destaddresses = moduleListByPath("**.host[*]", "**.fixhost[*]")
\item[-] moduleListByNedType("fully.qualified.ned.type",...): \\ 
         Returns a space-separated list of the modulenames with the given NED type(s).
         All modules whose getNedTypeName() is listed in the given parameters will get included.
         The NED type name is fully qualified.
         See cTopology::extractByNedTypeName() function
         example: destaddresses = moduleListByNedType("inet.nodes.inet.StandardHost")
\end{itemize}

The peer can be UDPSink or another UDPBasicBurst.

\subsubsection*{Bursts}

The first burst starts at \fpar{startTime}. Bursts start by immediately sending 
a packet; subsequent packets are sent at \fpar{sendInterval} intervals. The 
sendInterval parameter can be a random value, e.g. exponential(10ms).
A constant interval with jitter can be specified as 1s+uniform(-0.01s,0.01s)
or uniform(0.99s,1.01s). The length of the burst is controlled by the
\fpar{burstDuration} parameter. (Note that if \fpar{sendInterval} is greater than 
\fpar{burstDuration}, the burst will consist of one packet only.) The time between
burst is the \fpar{sleepDuration} parameter; this can be zero (zero is not
allowed for \fpar{sendInterval}.) The zero \fpar{burstDuration} is interpreted as infinity.

\subsubsection*{Packets}

Packet length is controlled by the \fpar{messageLength} parameter.

The module adds two parameters to packets before sending:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] sourceID: source module ID
\item[-] msgId: incremented by 1 after send any packet.
\end{itemize}
When received packet has this parameters, the module checks the order of received packets.

\subsubsection*{Operation as sink}

When \fpar{destAddresses} parameter is empty, the module receives packets and makes statistics only.

\subsubsection*{Statistics}

Statistics are collected on outgoing packets:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] sentPk: packet object
\end{itemize}

Statistics are collected on incoming packets:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] outOfOrderPk: statistics of out of order packets.
       The packet is out of order, when has msgId and sourceId parameters and module
       received bigger msgId from same sourceID.
\item[-] dropPk: statistics of dropped packets. 
       The packet is dropped when not out-of-order packet and delay time is larger than
       delayLimit parameter. The delayLimit=0 is infinity.
\item[-] rcvdPk: statistics of not dropped, not out-of-order packets.
\item[-] endToEndDelay: end to end delay statistics of not dropped, not out-of-order packets.
\end{itemize}
